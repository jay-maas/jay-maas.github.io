									<h3 class="major">My background</h3>
									<p>Like most stories, I will start from the beginning. I was born in Fort Hood, Texas. Raised in Farmington, NM, I would say that I have had somewhat of a peculiar upbringing.
										Not one so notable that my adventures as a youth could be made into entertainment in the form of film or text, but one that I am proud to share and I believe has been of major
										influence to my life. I was an only child, raised by my mother, and grandparents. They all were teachers. All possesing master's degrees. And ALL focused on me as a youth. 
										I suceeded as well in my eandovers in school, both academically and in extra curriculars. In high school I gained the honor of becoming a Double Honor Thesbian. As a young man
										I began a family with my beautiful wife, Jessica. We have two children, Jay and Kiana. Everyday we are thankful to God that we have been able to have such a great life. 
									</p>

									<p>Some of my earliest memories as a kid where playing on the computer. My grandfather impacted my life with his own. Being a computer science teacher, he was always up to date 
										on the latest and greatest as it where of the tech times. I always had the exposure into the industry, enjoyed arts considerably, but my interests never grew professionally until lately. 
									</p>

									<h3 class="major">Accomplishments and Other Interests</h3>
									<p>Thankfully I have many things to be proud of. I have enjoyed many succesful careers in different industries.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Carpentry</h3>
											<p>I have years of experience doing carpentry and construction related projects. I truly love working with my hands. I would love to someday
												go on a humanitarian mission and build houses for those in need. I discovered over time that the money wasn't what I enjoyed most 
												about working in the industry, it was the satisfaction of doing great work.

											<h3 class="major">Photography and Art</h3>
											<p>I love art. Studying it in high school for 3 years, as well as 3 years of theater, I have an appreciation for all different genres
												of art. Photography is one of my favorite practices, because like millions, I have a high resolution camera in my pocket all the time!
												I do not draw or paint much anymore, and enjoy working with digital mediums.
