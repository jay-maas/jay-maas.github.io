										<p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio page. My name is Jay Maas. I am currently a full time Full Stack Web Development student at <a href="https://lambdaschool.com/courses/cs/web/" target="blank">Lambda School</a>. 
										I have already begun my journey into the web development world. Gaining a firm understanding of html and css language, responsive design, and the GitFlow, I am bringing my projects 
									for all the world to see. I am excited to display my evergrowing knowledge, and my portolfio page will be a reflection of that. If you would like to know some more about me please click below!</p>

										<h2 class="major">Sprint Challenge</h2>
										<p>This challenge allowed me to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the first week and apply them into a concrete project. This Sprint explored User Interface and Git. During this Sprint, I studied Semantic HTML, 
											CSS Fundamentals, CSS Flexbox Module, and Git. In my challenge I have demonstrated proficiency by creating a multi page website that had some missing HTML elements as well as CSS specificity problems that were 
											to be solved. I also created two additional web pages that were linked from the navigation I built. I also worked through some of the stretch goals associated with this challenge. I was
											able to create a a contact page with several inputs using JavaScript, and also introduced CSS animations into the logo image. </p>

										<h2 class="major">Responsive Design</h2>
										<p>This project was a study into the world of responsive design. Accessibility is key to gain the most exposure to all of the devices available in the world that can utilize the internet.
											The main goal in this project was to create a responsive desing that could be viewed from different viewport sizes built upon a previous project that we had 
											been working on in the first week. Utilizing my new skills and understandings of the power of media queries as well as parent:child relationship and fluid layout,
											I was able to acheive MVP for the assignment and gain the experience necessary to continue forward. </p>
